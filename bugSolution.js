The root cause of this problem was often found to be inconsistencies or conflicts within the project's dependencies, especially concerning `react-native-screens`.  The solution involves carefully examining the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) files.  A clean install of the project's dependencies is also highly recommended.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
npm install react-native-screens --force
expo prebuild
expo build:android --clean
```
The `--clean` flag ensures a clean build, removing any potential cached artifacts that may contribute to the error.  If the issue persists, consider updating `react-native-screens` to its latest stable version, carefully checking for compatibility with other dependencies.
